# A realtime chat application to try Socket.io (SERVER)
A sample application to try some socket.io concepts. I started building it using the getting started guide from the socket.io website. Then I tried the different thoughts on how to take it a bit further.

## How to run it
Clone the repository then:
```
$ npm start
```

## How to build it
```
$ npm run build
```

## Dependencies
- Nodejs
- webpack
